# Hello-world

I have learned about git and github 
Git is a tool to manage your source code history. GitHub is a hosting service for Git repositories. So they are not the same thing: Git is the tool, GitHub is the service for projects that use Git.

and also how to make a clone and push and commit so you can edit your web via visual basic
